---

## Overview

Malware Scan checks that provided extension and all media files and documents do not contain any malicious code or links.

## Why we test?

Security is one of the top concerns for Magento. And we would like to provide same level of certainty for 3rd party extensions distributed at [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) as we have for Magento core components.

## When we test?

All uploaded files including package with submitted extension and all associated media files and documents are scanned before all other checks.

If Malware Scan is not passed submission will not be taken for further verification and validation.

## What we are looking for?

We check all files for:

1. Signatures of known viruses and malware software.
2. Links to sites with with harassment content.

## What tools and environment we are using?

To perform Malware Scan we use several tools:

1. General purpose antivirus with automatically updated virus database.
2. [Yara](https://github.com/virustotal/yara) with set of Magento-specific rules.

## How read an error report?

Magento Developer Portal will notify user about detected malware software or malicious link during files uploading. 

If you receive such method please check integrity of submitted extension source code and scan environment where package was generated with an antivirus.

## Troubleshooting

If you have failed Malware Scan on valid extension please [create a Support ticket](https://marketplacesupport.magento.com/hc/en-us) amd describe your use case.

If you find any code at [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) that looks suspicious please contact as immediately at or [Support Portal](https://marketplacesupport.magento.com/hc/en-us). 

We also always glad for feedback and communication at [Magento Community Engineering Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/archives/C7SL5CGDN) #marketplace channel.
