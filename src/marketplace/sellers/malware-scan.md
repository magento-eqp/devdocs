title: Malware Scan
---

## Overview

Malware Scan checks that the provided extension and all media files and documents do not contain any malicious code or links.

## What testing is for

Security is one of the top concerns for Magento. Malware Scan prevents extensions that contain malicious code or viruses from being listed at [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).

## When testing is done

All uploaded files, including the submitted extension and all associated media files and documents are scanned before all other checks.

If the Malware Scan is not passed, submission will not be taken for further verification and validation.

## What is being checked

All files are checked for :

1. Signatures of known viruses and malware software.
1. Links to sites with harassment content.

## Tools and environments used

To perform the Malware Scan several tools are used :

1. General purpose antivirus with automatically updated virus database.
1. [Yara](https://github.com/virustotal/yara) with a set of Magento specific rules.

## Reading the error report

The Magento Developer Portal will notify the user about detected malware software or malicious links during file upload.

If Malware Scan failed please check the integrity of the submitted extension source code and scan an environment where the package was generated with an antivirus.

## Troubleshooting

If the Malware Scan fails on a valid extension [create a Support ticket](https://marketplacesupport.magento.com/hc/en-us) and describe the use case.

If any code is found on the  [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) that looks suspicious contact Magento immediately on the [Support Portal](https://marketplacesupport.magento.com/hc/en-us).

Feedback and communication on the [Magento Community Engineering Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/archives/C7SL5CGDN) #marketplace channel is always welcome.
